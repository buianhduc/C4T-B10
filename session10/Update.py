MyFavArtist['Description'] = '''OneRepublic is an American pop rock band formed in Colorado Springs, Colorado,[2] in 2002. 
It consists of lead vocalist & multi-instrumentalist Ryan Tedder, guitarist Zach Filkins, guitarist Drew Brown, 
bassist and cellist Brent Kutzle, drummer Eddie Fisher and keyboardist Brian Willett. 
The band first achieved commercial success on Myspace as an unsigned act.[3] 
In late 2002, after OneRepublic played shows throughout the Los Angeles area, a number of record labels approached the band with interest, 
but the band ultimately signed with Velvet Hammer, an imprint of Columbia Records. They made their first album with producer 
Greg Wells during the summer and fall of 2005 at his studio, Rocket Carousel, in Culver City, California. 
The album was originally scheduled for release on June 6, 2006, but the group was dropped by Columbia two months before the album came out. 
The lead single of that album, Apologize, was released on April 30, 2006, on Myspace and received some recognition there, becoming number one on the Myspace charts.'''
